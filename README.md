The Life Expectancy project helps predict the average number of years an
individual or group of people can live, depending on the previous data collected. This project is an effort
from our side to evaluate some of the factors and how these factors influence the life expectancy. We are
using ‘Life Expectancy Data’ collected by World Health Organization, found in Global Health
Observatory data repository. The dataset contains information collected for 183 countries from years
2000-2015.
For our project, we will be training and testing the models with 2010 dataset. Considering the entire
dataset for years 2000-2015, will lead us to performing time series analysis, which is out of scope of our
project.
Predictor Variables - Life expectancy response variable depends on important predictor factors like
Mortality (Adult mortality, infant deaths, under-five deaths, HIV/AIDS), Immunization (Hepatitis B,
Polio, Diphtheria), GDP, Population, Health services (Total Expenditure), Income and Education.
 Life Expectancy – Average number of years an individual is expected to live.
 Status – Developed or Developing status of a country.
 Adult mortality – Probability of dying between 15 and 60 years per 1000 population.
 Infant deaths – Number of infant deaths per 1000 population.
 Alcohol – Average alcohol consumption in liters.
 Percentage expenditure – Amount spent on health as a percentage of GDP (%)
 Hepatitis B – Immunization coverage among 1-year-olds (%)
 Measles –Cases of measles reported per 1000 population.
 BMI – Average body mass index.
 Polio – Polio immunization coverage among 1-year-olds (%)
 Under-five deaths – Deaths under the age of 5 per 1000 population.
 Total expenditure – General expenditure on health as a percentage of total
 overnment expenditure (%)
 Diphtheria – Diphtheria immunization coverage among 1-year-olds (%)
 HIV/AIDS – Deaths per 1000 live births HIV/AIDS (0-4 years)
 GDP – Gross Domestic Product per capita (in USD)
 Population – Population of the country.
 Thinness 1-19 years – malnutrition among children and adolescents of age 1-19 (%)
 Thinness 5-9 years – malnutrition among children and adolescents of age 5-9 (%)
 Income composition of resources - Human Development Index in terms of income
 composition of resources (index ranging from 0 to 1). Human Development Index is
 a criteria for assessing the development of a country.
 Schooling – Average years of schooling

Project’s application
 Predicting life expectancy – We can predict future life expectancy utilizing the current
data.
 Getting acquainted with the variables that affect the life expectancy.
 Based on our results, we will be able to interpret the most critical factors affecting the life
expectancy. For example, from scatter plot of life expectancy-schooling, average number
of years of schooling has a positive effect on life expectancy. From this, we can conclude
that importance should be given to increase the average number of years of schooling if
we have to increase life expectancy.
